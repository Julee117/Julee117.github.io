I was at the point of wanting to change careers and trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to do something creative and have a career that also helps people. One day, I came across an article on why children should learn to code. I did not know anything about coding. To be honest, growing up, I never had much interest in computers besides talking to my friends online. The article spoke about how computational thinking teaches us how to tackle large problems by breaking them down into a sequence of smaller problems, which allows us to tackle complex problems in efficient ways.  This interested me and made me look further into technology.

I came across a story of a father creating an app called [TippyTalk](http://www.tippy-talk.com/). He has a nonverbal autistic daughter who would get frustrated due to being unable to express herself. He created a touchscreen communication system, which takes a picture exchange communication system (PECS) board to a computer, tablet or phone, and transfers the pictures to text messages. I found this story to be inspiring. This father was able to help his daughter communicate. 

Technology is always evolving. The possibilities are limitless. In recent news, I read an article of JP Morgan integrating artificial intelligence in their automated trading platforms and Google being at the brink of developing the worldâ€™s first quantum computer. These tools and others like it can serve as the base of the next big innovation in helping people on a wider scale and creating value. This is the reason why I wanted to immerse myself into software development.
